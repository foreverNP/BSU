# Task 0.6. Palindrome

- Time limit: 1 sec
- Memory limit: no

A non-empty string S is entered, which has a length of no more than 7000 characters and consists only of lowercase Latin letters. It is necessary to remove the minimum number of characters from the string so that you get a palindrome (a string of characters that reads from left to right and from right to left the same way).

## Input data format
The first line contains the original string S.
## Output data format
Print the length of the resulting palindrome in the first line, and the palindrome itself in the second line (if there are several palindromes, then print only one of them).
