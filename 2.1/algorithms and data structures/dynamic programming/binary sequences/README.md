# Task 12. Binary Sequences

Given two binary sequences x and y of lengths n and m, respectively, both consisting of 0s and 1s, treat them as binary representations of positive integers. Find the maximum number z whose binary representation can be obtained by removing digits from both x and y. Output z as a binary sequence.

## Input Format

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 3000).
The next two lines contain the elements of sequences x and y, respectively.
It is guaranteed that the given strings have at least one common character.

## Output Format

The first line should contain the number of digits in the binary representation of z.
The second line should contain the binary representation of z.
For example, if x = 10101 and y = 11011, the maximum z would be 1111.
