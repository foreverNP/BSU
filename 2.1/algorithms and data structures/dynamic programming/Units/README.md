The number $N$ is given. It is necessary to determine how many binary strings of length $N$ are in which there are exactly $K$ units.

## Input data format 

The first line of input data contains two non-negative integers $N$ and $K$ $(0\le K\le N\le 10^6)$.

## Output data format

enter one number - the answer to the problem. Since the answer can be very large, it is necessary to output it modulo $10^9 + 7$.
