# Task 0.8. String conversion

- Time limit: 1 sec
- Memory limit: no

Two character sequences A and B are input, each sequence is not empty, consists of small Latin letters and has a length of no more than 1000 characters. It is necessary to convert sequence A to sequence B with a minimum total penalty, which is determined as follows:
- removing a character from A string is equal to x points;
- inserting a character into line A is equal to y points;
- replacing a character in line A with any other is equal to points.

## Input data format
The first three lines contain the numbers x, y, and z, respectively. All numbers are positive integers and do not exceed 1,000,000.
The next two lines contain the character sequences A and B (the type of sequence elements is string).

## Output data format
Print the minimum total penalty.
